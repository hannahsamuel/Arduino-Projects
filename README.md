# Arduino-Projects
 During quurantine and the transition to in-person schooling, I taught myself how to code in the Arduino IDE platform and futher develop my understanding or circuits. Below are a series of projects I went through to teach myself how to use the Arduino Uno and its electrical components. 
 
 ### Multitasking the arduino
 This projects covers the primay concepts of running code that performs multiple function for different component on a programed circuit. The program here is to blink LEDs while rotating a servo motor. The program implements a millis() function that tracks the schedule of what code is being run on different components which allows us to run certain commands like alternating between HIGH and LOW on LEDs while rotating the servo motor
